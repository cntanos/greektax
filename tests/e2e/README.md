# End-to-End Testing Scaffold

Browser-driven tests are intentionally deferred until the API stabilises and the
design system is finalised. When those milestones land we will introduce
Playwright-based scenarios that cover the full journey from data entry to the
bilingual report download. Until then the directory remains as documentation so
infrastructure can be prepared without shipping brittle placeholders.
