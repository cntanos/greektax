GreekTax Web Application Requirements
Overview
GreekTax is an unofficial web application designed to help Greek taxpayers estimate their annual income taxes and related obligations for a selected tax year (starting from 2024 onward). It provides an easy-to-use interface (planned to be modernized in the future) where users can choose the tax year and input their financial data. Based on the Greek tax code rules for the selected year, the app calculates income tax and additional taxes or contributions. The tool is inspired by the functionality of AfterTax.gr (which calculates net salary from gross and vice versa) but will extend to cover freelancers (ελεύθεροι επαγγελματίες) and other income sources beyond salaried employment. The interface and outputs will be bilingual (Greek and English), catering to a broad user base. All code (and code comments) will be written in English (using Greek terminology where necessary). The application will be built with simple, common web technologies (HTML, CSS for the front-end, and PHP/Python for back-end logic), ensuring easy deployment and maintainability. A prominent disclaimer will state that GreekTax is not an official calculator and is provided “as-is” for single-use calculations, without any data being stored. In summary, GreekTax will serve as a comprehensive tax calculation tool for individuals, covering all major income categories and tax obligations as per Greek law, while emphasizing ease of use and clarity.
Functional Requirements
1.	Year Selection & Configuration: The user shall be able to select the tax year for which they want to perform the calculation (starting from 2024). The system will maintain a configuration per year – i.e. a set of tax rates, brackets, deductions, and rules corresponding to that year’s tax code. Selecting a different year will automatically apply the appropriate rules and thresholds for calculations (e.g. tax brackets, applicable deductions, special contributions). This allows the tool to adapt to law changes each year[1][2]. For example, if year 2024 is chosen, the progressive income tax rates (9% to 44%) for 2024 will be used[3], whereas a future year’s selection might load updated brackets. This modular year-based config approach makes it easy to update the app for new years or policy changes.
2.	Income Input Categories: The application will support input of all major/common categories of personal income (aligned with Greek tax forms E1 and E3). Users will enter their annual income amounts for each relevant category, so that the app can calculate taxes appropriately for each source. The main income categories include:
3.	Employment Income: Salary or wage earnings from employment. Users can input their gross salary for the year (and optionally any tax already withheld). The app will calculate income tax on this salary using the progressive rates and apply the standard tax credit (μείωση φόρου) for salaried employees. It can also calculate social security contributions for illustration (about 16% employee contribution to EFKA on gross salary[4]) to derive net take-home pay, similar to AfterTax.gr’s net salary calculation. If the user inputs net salary, the app should be able to reverse-calculate the gross (though initial focus is gross-to-net). The goal is to replicate AfterTax-style functionality for salaries (gross-to-net and net-to-gross conversion, showing tax and contributions breakdown).
4.	Pension Income: Annual pension amounts, taxed under employment income brackets. Pensions typically follow the same tax scale as salaries and also were subject to solidarity contribution (when it existed) in the past[1]. The user can input total pension received; the app will apply relevant tax brackets and any deductions.
5.	Self-Employment/Freelance Income (Business Profits): Net profit from business activities or freelance work (form E3 income). Users (freelancers, sole proprietors, small businesses) will input either their net taxable profit for the year or their gross revenue and expenses (to compute profit). The app will treat this as taxable income under the progressive tax rates (same scale as employment income[5]). If gross revenue/expenses are provided, the app calculates profit = revenue minus allowable expenses. It should also automatically account for the “business activities tax” (τέλος επιτηδεύματος) for freelancers: this is a fixed annual fee (traditionally around €650 per year for self-employed individuals, varying by locale) which is added to the tax bill[6]. For example, a freelancer in Athens might have €1,000 added as the trade fee, while one in a smaller town would have €650[6]. The app will include this in the final tax calculation if applicable (perhaps asking the user to confirm their status and/or location to determine the amount). Freelance income will also later be combined with salary income (if the user has both) to compute total tax, as per Greek rules (progressive scale on total income).
6.	Agricultural Income: Income from farming or agricultural activities. This can be input separately because in some cases different rates or tax treatments may apply (though currently agriculture profits are also taxed under the standard scale, with some special exemptions or reductions potentially). The app will treat it similarly to freelance income (taxed progressively) unless specific rules for that year dictate otherwise (the year-config can include any special treatment, e.g., a lower starting tax rate for farmers in certain years).
7.	Rental Income (Real Estate): Income from property rentals (form E2 details, flows to E1). Users can input their total rent income for the year. The app will apply the separate progressive tax rates for rental income, which differ from the employment income rates[7]. For example, as of 2024, rental income is taxed at 15% up to €12,000, 35% for €12,001–€35,000, and 45% beyond that[8]. These rates (and any year-specific changes) will be part of the year configuration. Rental income tax will be calculated independently and then added to the total tax due. (No solidarity surcharge applies on rents as of 2023 onward, since it was abolished[1].) The app will also allow input of any deductible expenses related to rentals (like maintenance costs that are tax-deductible by a certain percentage, if applicable by law).
8.	Investment & Capital Income: This includes dividends, interest, capital gains, etc. Users can input amounts like dividends received, interest earned, or capital gains. These are typically taxed at flat rates at the source: e.g., dividends at 5%, interest at 15%, capital gains (from stocks or property sales) at 15% (with some exceptions)[9]. The app will not recalculate those (since they might have been taxed via withholding), but for completeness it can show the expected tax on them. For instance, if the user enters €100 in interest, the app could show €15 tax (15%) on interest income[10]. Alternatively, the app might simply list these in the output for informational purposes (since those taxes are often withheld by banks/brokers). Investment income can be added to the final summary if the user wants to see total tax including these sources.
9.	Other Income: Any other less common income types covered in E1, such as unemployment benefits (usually tax-free up to a point), royalties, etc., can be included as needed. For completeness, the app’s design will allow adding new income fields if the tax law introduces new categories or if the user has a unique income source (e.g., crypto earnings can be treated as capital gains by the user’s input choice, since crypto profits are taxed as capital gains in Greece[11]).
10.	Deductions and Contributions Inputs: The app will allow users to enter relevant deductions, contributions, or tax credits information, to accurately adjust the taxable income or final tax. Key inputs in this category include:
11.	Social Security Contributions (EFKA): For freelancers/self-employed users, the EFKA contributions (main pension fund payments) are deductible expenses from gross income. The app should provide fields for the user to input how much they paid in EFKA contributions for the year (as well as any auxiliary pension or lump-sum fund contributions if they are, for example, engineers or lawyers with such requirements). These amounts will be subtracted from the business or freelance income before calculating income tax, since mandatory social insurance payments reduce taxable income[12][13]. For example, if a freelancer earned €30,000 and paid €6,000 to EFKA (which is roughly the 20% pension + health contribution on that income[14]), the taxable income used for tax calculation would be €24,000. The interface might have separate fields for “Main EFKA contribution”, “Auxiliary pension contribution (επικουρική)”, and “Lump-sum fund (εφάπαξ) contribution” to accommodate professions like engineers who pay multiple types. These fields are primarily for calculation of net taxable income and to inform the user’s net earnings after all obligations.
12.	Tax Deductions/Credits: Common deductions or credits applicable to the selected year should be supported. For instance, the tax-free threshold / tax credit for salary and pension income (which is automatically applied based on income and number of dependent children) will be part of the calculation logic (no user input needed other than number of children). In Greece, salaried taxpayers get a tax reduction up to €777 for low incomes, increasing with dependents[15]. The app should ask for number of dependent children (0, 1, 2, 3+) to adjust this credit if the year’s rules use it[16][17]. Other deductible expenses or allowances the user might claim can also be input. For example: medical expenses, charitable donations (eligible for a 20% deduction up to certain limits[12]), education tuition, or insurance premiums, if those are considered in that tax year’s law. The app will subtract allowable deductions from the appropriate income category or from the final tax as credits, as per the rules. Each year’s config will define what deductions are available and how they’re applied.
13.	VAT (ΦΠΑ): While Value Added Tax is not part of income tax, the app will include an optional field for VAT for self-employed users who want to factor in their VAT obligations. For instance, a freelancer can enter their VAT due for the year (or quarter) if they know it, simply to see the overall picture of taxes. The app is not meant to compute VAT from scratch (since that requires knowing taxable sales and purchases, and Greek VAT is generally 24% standard rate[18]), but it can assist by maybe calculating a rough amount if the user provides their revenue and indicates the rate. In essence, VAT will be treated as an additional output item: the user can input the amount of VAT they paid/owe, and the app will include this in a summary of “other taxes”. (No complex VAT filing calculations will be done; this is for completeness of the financial picture).
14.	ENFIA (Property Tax): The app will not calculate ENFIA (the annual property ownership tax), as ENFIA is determined by detailed property parameters and calculated by the tax authority[19][20]. However, to give users a full view of their taxes, the interface will have an input for “ENFIA amount”. Users who know their annual ENFIA bill (from their E9/ENFIA statement) can enter it, and the app will simply include it in the final tally of taxes. This input is manual (added amount) as per the requirement (no internal ENFIA computation) – essentially, ENFIA will appear as a line item added to the total tax obligation. This addresses property owners’ total outflow but with the understanding that GreekTax isn’t computing it (and will note that ENFIA is calculated separately by the tax authority[21]).
15.	Solidarity Contribution (Εισφορά Αλληλεγγύης): For completeness, the app’s design will account for the solidarity contribution in years it was applicable. The special solidarity tax was an additional tax on incomes over certain thresholds. However, as of 2023, it has been abolished for all types of income[2]. If a user were to calculate for 2024 or later, no solidarity contribution is added. (If the app in future allows year 2022 or earlier, it would then need to compute solidarity tax on applicable income portions – for example, in 2022 it applied only to public-sector salaries and pensions[1]). In the current scope (2024+), this field may simply be present but set to zero or hidden. If present, it can be an output field showing “Solidarity Contribution: €0” for years 2024 onward, with a note that it was abolished[2].
16.	Business/Professional Fee (Τέλος Επιτηδεύματος): As noted under freelance income, the app will handle the annual business fee automatically when relevant. This is not an input but a calculated addition: if any self-employed or business income is entered, the app will add the standard fee (e.g. €650) to the tax results. Possibly, a checkbox “Include Trade Fee (επιτηδεύματος)” could let the user toggle it (since new businesses in their first 5 years or those with very low income might be exempt by law). By default, after year 2025, this fee may even be abolished (there have been policy discussions), so the year config will reflect whether to include it. For now, it’s included as per current rules[6].
17.	Luxury Living Tax (Φόρος Πολυτελούς Διαβίωσης): The app should have a provision for taxes on luxury assets (e.g. high-displacement cars, swimming pools, private planes, etc.), often referred to as “luxury living tax”. This is a separate tax calculated on the ownership of luxury items (usually a percentage of deemed value or a flat amount based on engine size, etc.). The exact calculation is complex and depends on asset details, so the app will not calculate it automatically. Instead, similar to ENFIA, users will have an input field to enter any luxury tax they owe (if known). It will then include that in the total tax summary. For instance, if someone knows they pay €500 for owning a luxury car, they can input that. In the future, if feasible, the app could include a helper for this (like “engine CC of car” to estimate the luxury tax), but initially it’s manual.
18.	Other Taxes: Any other common taxes or contributions can be included in a general input section. This might include things like municipal taxes or the special fee for rental properties (if any), etc. For example, if there’s a small radio/TV fee or something included in tax forms, users can add it. The idea is to make the app a one-stop summary of one’s tax-related payments by allowing miscellaneous entries. These will simply be summed in the final output. (Developers can keep this extensible for new tax types).
19.	Tax Calculation Rules: Once the user has entered all relevant data, the system shall perform the tax calculations according to Greek tax law for the selected year. The functional steps in calculation include:
20.	Progressive Tax on Total Income: Calculate income tax on the taxable income from salaries, pensions, freelance, agriculture, etc., using the progressive rate brackets of that year. For 2024 onwards, the rates are 9%, 22%, 28%, 36%, 44% at the respective income intervals[3] (these brackets can be adjusted per year via config). The calculation should apply the progressive rates correctly (marginal taxation[22]). For example, if a user’s combined taxable income from salary and freelance work is €25,000, the tax would be: 9% on the first €10k, 22% on the next €10k, and 28% on the remaining €5k. The app will sum these to get total basic income tax. If multiple income sources are present, they are aggregated where applicable (salary+freelance+other regular income add together for the progressive tax). Rental income is excluded from this aggregation and taxed on its own scale as described, and investment income at flat rates – those will be computed separately and then all added.
21.	Separate Tax Computations: The app must handle parallel tax computations for different income types:
o	Regular income (employment, pension, business) → taxed with main progressive scale (after deductions).
o	Rental income → taxed with rental scale (progressive 15/35/45% brackets)[7].
o	Dividends → taxed at flat 5% (if the user wants to include this, though typically withheld at source)[10].
o	Interest → taxed at flat 15%[10].
o	Capital gains → usually flat 15% (or variable if specified). The app will compute each category’s tax separately as required, then combine them for a total tax liability. It will clearly label each in the results (e.g., “Tax on salary income: X”, “Tax on rents: Y”, etc.). This mirrors how the Greek tax form E1 calculates taxes in sections (with rental taxed separately, etc.).
22.	Apply Tax Credits: After computing the gross tax from the above, the app will apply any tax credits. For example, the tax-free credit (μείωση φόρου) for salaries/pensions: up to €777 credit for a single person (more if dependents) is effectively a reduction in tax, which the app will subtract from the computed tax for those incomes[15]. The year’s config will specify the credit amounts and phase-out rules. Other credits like foreign tax credit (if user inputs tax paid abroad on foreign income) or credits for donations (as a percentage of donation) will also be applied at this stage if applicable.
23.	Include Additional Taxes: Add on the fixed and miscellaneous taxes:
o	Trade Fee (τέλος επιτηδεύματος): If applicable, add €650 (or relevant amount) to the tax. This will appear as a separate line in results.
o	Solidarity Contribution: If it were applicable (for older years), compute as a percentage on income portions above threshold (e.g., historically 2.2%–10% on income over €12,000 in older years). For 2024+, this will be zero but still show if the architecture includes it (for completeness, or skip if year says none).
o	Any user-input taxes: ENFIA, luxury tax, etc., are simply added as provided (no calculation needed, just inclusion).
o	VAT: If the user entered a VAT amount, it’s not added to income tax (since it’s an entirely separate obligation), but the results page might show it as “VAT to remit: [the input amount]” to remind the user of that liability. Possibly, the app could compute a net income after all taxes by subtracting income tax, trade fee, solidarity (if any), VAT, etc., from gross income. This would give a “what do I get to keep” figure for the user’s planning.
24.	Rounding and Precision: All calculations should be done with proper rounding as per currency standards (e.g., cents rounding). Tax law often specifies rounding of the final tax to the nearest euro; the app should emulate such rules if applicable (year config can note rounding conventions).
25.	Output and Results Display: After calculation, the app will display a clear breakdown of the results to the user. This output will be organized (potentially in a summary table or labeled sections) to enhance understanding:
26.	Summary of Income: A recap of all inputs the user provided, possibly grouped (e.g., “Total employment income: €…, Total freelance income: €…, Rental income: €…, etc.”). This helps the user verify their inputs.
27.	Tax Calculation Breakdown: A detailed breakdown of the tax computed for each category:
o	For regular income: show taxable income after deductions and the tax on it. Potentially, break it down by bracket (e.g., “€X taxed at 9% = €Y, €X taxed at 22% = €Y, …” for transparency).
o	For rental: show the rental income and how it was taxed (similar breakdown by 15/35/45% bands).
o	For dividends/interest: show flat tax applied (e.g., “Dividend income €D at 5% = €(0.05*D)”).
o	Any credits applied (e.g., “Tax credit for salary/pension: –€777”) shown as subtractions.
o	Trade fee, etc., shown as additions.
This breakdown will let users see how each part of their input contributes to the final tax.
28.	Total Tax Liability: The sum total tax amount the user is expected to pay for the year (income tax + any additional taxes like trade fee or solidarity that were calculated). This is a key output, likely highlighted (e.g., “Total Annual Income Tax: €X”).
29.	Effective Tax Rate / Net Income: The app may also present some useful derived info, such as the effective tax rate (total tax divided by total income, as a percentage) to give users an idea of their overall tax burden. Additionally, for those with employment income, it can show net income after tax. For instance, if someone entered gross salary, the app would show “Net take-home from salary: €… per year (or per month)”, after subtracting income tax and social contributions. This is similar to what AfterTax.gr provides – e.g., showing employer contributions, employee contributions, and net salary[23]. For freelancers, it could show “Net income after tax and EFKA: …”, indicating how much of their earnings remain after all taxes and social insurance. These insights help the user understand the impact of taxes on their income.
30.	Incomes from Rent/Investments: If the user included rental or investment income, the output should separately show the tax on those (as they are often handled separately). E.g., “Tax on rental income: €Z (already included in total above)” to make it clear. The app should also mention if certain investment taxes are assumed withheld (so the user doesn’t double-pay). For example, “Dividend tax 5%: €X (usually withheld at source)”.
31.	Other Taxes Summary: If the user entered ENFIA, VAT, luxury tax, etc., these can be summed up in a separate section, e.g., “Other annual taxes: ENFIA €…, Luxury tax €…, Total other taxes: €…”. This is then optionally combined with income tax for a grand total of all obligations, or just left as informational.
32.	Disclaimer: On the results page (and perhaps at the bottom of input page as well), display a disclaimer that this is not an official tax computation. It should state that calculations are based on the provided data and the configured tax rules, and while the app aims for accuracy, the official tax assessment by AADE may differ. The user should consult an accountant or official sources for final confirmation. This fulfills the requirement that the app is provided “as-is” with no guarantees, simply as a helpful tool.
33.	User Interface: The application will have a simple, clean web-based UI for now (with a plan to modernize it in the future). Key UI requirements include:
34.	Bilingual Display: All labels, field names, and messages will be available in both Greek and English. Users can toggle the interface language (for example, via a flag icon or dropdown). By default, it might detect the browser language or start in Greek (since it’s for Greek taxes) with an option to switch to English. All tax terms should be carefully translated or presented in both languages (possibly with tooltips explaining Greek-specific terms in English). For example, a label might show “Μισθός (Salary)”, or just “Salary” when English is selected. Being bilingual greatly broadens the accessibility, serving both Greek locals and foreigners who pay taxes in Greece.
35.	Input Forms: The data entry should be organized into logical sections, probably one section per category of input. For example, a section for “Employment/Pension Income” (with fields for gross salary, pension, etc.), a section for “Self-Employment” (fields for profit, EFKA contributions, etc.), a section for “Property Income”, “Investments”, and “Other/Additional taxes”. Each section will have explanatory text so users know what to input. Fields should have units (e.g., euro signs) and possibly validation (only numeric input, no negatives, etc.). The design will be kept simple (HTML/CSS, minimal JavaScript) but intuitive.
36.	Calculation Trigger: A clear action (like a “Calculate” button) will start the computation and then the page will show results. Given the simplicity, this could be a form submission to a server script (in PHP/Python) which returns a results page. In the future a more dynamic interface (using JavaScript or a modern framework) might allow instant calculations, but initially a round-trip form submission is acceptable.
37.	Results Presentation: As described, results will be shown in a well-structured format with headings and tables if needed. Important figures (total tax, net income, etc.) might be highlighted. The bilingual aspect means results labels must also switch language accordingly.
38.	Modern Web Interface (Future): Although initial implementation can be basic, the architecture should not hinder an upgrade to a modern UI. In the future, the plan is to perhaps have a more interactive, possibly single-page application interface. Thus, separating calculation logic (possibly in Python or a backend API) from the presentation will be wise. In other words, the functional core could be an API or a Python module that calculates taxes, and the front-end (whether PHP-templated or a JS framework later) calls it. This ensures that improving the interface later (for example, adding interactive graphs, or a more responsive design for mobile) will not require re-writing the calculation logic.
39.	No Login / Single-Use: The app is intended for one-off calculations, so it will not require user accounts or login. A user comes to the site, enters data, sees results. There is no data saved server-side (unless basic analytics). Each calculation is essentially stateless once done (aside from what standard web server logs capture). This is a conscious design choice for simplicity and privacy. “Single-use” means the app does not store your financial data – if the user revisits or refreshes, they’d have to input again. This also reduces any personal data handling concerns.
40.	Accessibility & Form Design: The form and results should be accessible (labels tied to inputs, responsive layout for different screen sizes, etc.). While fancy styling is not required initially, a clean design with CSS will make it easier to scan and understand the outputs. Headings, bullet lists, or tables will be used in the results to make the breakdown clear (mirroring how we have structured information in this document).
41.	Technology and Implementation Constraints: The solution will be implemented using common web technologies:
42.	The front-end will use HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling. Any interactivity can be achieved with plain JavaScript if needed (to toggle languages or do simple dynamic calculation), but a heavy front-end framework is intentionally avoided to keep it simple.
43.	The back-end can use PHP and/or Python. This could mean either a PHP script that handles the form and calls a Python program for calculations, or one of these languages alone. Both are mentioned to underline that the project should rely on well-known languages (for example, PHP is common in web hosting, and Python is powerful for calculations and could also be used with a framework like Flask/Django if needed). The exact architecture will be decided by the developer, but it must remain simple to deploy (e.g., it could even run as a CGI Python script or a command-line Python called by PHP). The inclusion of Python suggests possibly using Python’s clarity for the tax logic computations (which might make formulae easier to express), while PHP could handle web form submission if needed. In any case, no proprietary software or unusual frameworks should be required to run GreekTax – any standard LAMP stack or a server with Python would suffice.
44.	Data storage: Since no user accounts, there’s no need for a database to store user data. The only data storage might be configuration files for tax parameters per year (could be JSON, CSV, or even PHP/Python arrays). These config files per year will contain the tax brackets, rates, credits, etc., and can be easily updated each fiscal year. This design makes maintenance straightforward: to update for 2025, one would create (or edit) a config entry for 2025 with any changed rates (for instance, if tax brackets adjust for inflation). The code then uses this config to drive calculations.
45.	Accuracy and Validation: The app should strive for accuracy in all calculations:
46.	The tax formulas and rules for each year should be verified against official sources or at least credible tax summary sources to ensure correctness. (For instance, ensuring the brackets for 2024 match the official Greek tax rates[24], verifying that the tax credit amounts are correct, etc.).
47.	We will include unit tests or example scenarios during development (not a user feature, but a functional requirement for development) to test that, say, a known income yields the expected tax. For example, a known case: €20,000 salary should result in a certain tax under 2024 rules (taking into account the €777 credit). Similar known outcomes for rental income or freelancer income can be tested. This ensures the logic is reliable.
48.	Input validation is also important: the app should validate that inputs are numeric where required, non-negative, and in reasonable ranges. If a user enters something nonsensical (like text where a number is needed, or extremely high values), the app should handle it gracefully (either by input constraints or by showing a clear error message).
49.	Security and Privacy: Even though the app does not handle sensitive personal data beyond what the user enters in that session, it should still adhere to good security practices:
50.	Use HTTPS for deployment to protect data in transit (especially since financial data is sensitive to the user, even if not stored).
51.	Do not log or store the detailed inputs on the server. If any logging is needed (for instance, for improving the tool by seeing usage patterns), it should be anonymized or optional.
52.	The code should be written securely (avoid eval/injection issues, since we might use user input in calculations).
53.	Since technologies like PHP are involved, care must be taken to sanitize inputs (though mostly numeric) to avoid any exploitation (especially if ever extended to more complex inputs).
54.	The disclaimer mentioned before also serves to reduce liability, but from a user’s perspective, privacy-wise, they should be assured that their inputs are not saved or shared. This can be stated on the site.
By fulfilling the above functional requirements, GreekTax will allow a user to comprehensively input their income and relevant tax data for a given year and receive a detailed computation of their tax obligations in Greece, including income tax and various surcharges or additional taxes. The functional scope covers both employees and freelancers, as well as property owners and investors – essentially mirroring what one would include in the official tax forms E1 (personal income), E2 (rental income), and E3 (business income)[25]. Incomes from salary, business, rents, investments, etc., are all accounted for, and the necessary taxes (income tax, VAT, ENFIA, etc.) and contributions (EFKA) are either calculated or included. The interface being bilingual and user-friendly ensures that both Greek-speaking users and English-speaking users (e.g., expats) can navigate the tool.
Non-Functional Requirements
1.	Usability & Clarity: The application must be easy to use, with a focus on clarity in both input and output. The information should be well-organized (using headings, bullet points, tables where appropriate) so that users can quickly scan and understand the results. Readability is paramount – for example, the results page will not just dump numbers but will clearly label each figure (in the selected language) with what it represents. The use of short explanatory texts and logical grouping (as detailed in the functional section) will ensure the user isn’t overwhelmed. Even non-expert users should be able to follow how the tax was calculated. In short, the UI/UX should follow the principle of KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): no unnecessary steps, all common scenarios covered, and helpful guidance where needed.
2.	Performance: The app’s calculations should be performed quickly and efficiently. Given the calculation is not heavy (mostly arithmetic operations on user-provided numbers), the response after hitting “Calculate” should be near-instantaneous (well under a second on typical servers for average use). The system should handle multiple users concurrently if hosted online (typical web server scaling), though we expect relatively light usage. The design using simple tech (PHP/Python without heavy frameworks) helps keep the performance overhead low. If a user tries different scenarios (e.g., changing inputs and recalculating), the app should handle repeated calculations without slowdown. In essence, speed and responsiveness should make the tool feel instant, closely matching the user’s expectation of an interactive calculator.
3.	Maintainability & Extensibility: The codebase should be maintainable by other developers or by the original developer over time:
4.	Using English for code and comments (with only necessary Greek terms) ensures that even non-Greek-speaking developers can understand the logic. Critical parts of the code will be commented to explain the tax calculations, citing the law or formula being implemented (for example, a comment might say “// 2024: 9% up to 10k, 22% for next 10k, etc, per Law XXXX[24]” to document the source of the rule). This makes updates in future years easier, as one can compare new laws to what’s in code.
5.	The configuration-per-year approach is a major maintainability feature: when tax rules change (rates, brackets, new taxes, abolished taxes), one can update the config for that new year without altering the core logic. The system will pick up the new parameters. Similarly, adding a new input category (say, a new type of deductible or a new tax incentive) should be possible by extending the input form and writing a small handler for it, largely isolated from other components.
6.	The use of common technologies (HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, Python) means many developers are familiar with them, and deploying the app on common platforms is straightforward. There’s no vendor lock-in or obscure dependency. This also means upgrades (like moving from PHP to a Python web framework, or vice versa) are possible if needed, without starting from scratch, because the logic can be ported in a familiar language environment.
7.	The project will use version control (e.g., a GitHub repository as indicated) to track changes, which aids maintainability. If open-sourced or shared, it could get contributions (especially since code is in English and modular).
8.	Extensibility: The architecture should allow adding new years easily and potentially new modules. For instance, if in the future an API is desired (to allow other apps to consume the calculator), the logic could be exposed via a REST API. Or if a decision is made to incorporate corporate tax calculations (though out of current scope), the design shouldn’t preclude adding a module for that. Essentially, keep the code modular and organized by function (input handling, calculation, output formatting separated).
9.	Accuracy & Reliability: Although mentioned under functional testing, as a non-functional requirement, the app must be reliable in its output. Reliability here means:
10.	Correctness: For all typical inputs, the calculations should match the expected outcome as per law. If the user were to do the same calculation manually or via an accountant, the tool’s result should be the same (barring rounding differences). This builds user trust. Any discrepancies found should be treated as bugs to fix promptly.
11.	Edge Cases: The app should handle edge cases gracefully. For example, zero income should result in zero tax (and not error out). Extremely high income should still calculate (within language numeric limits) and perhaps warn if beyond typical ranges. If a user leaves a non-required field empty, it should be treated as zero. If all fields are empty, the result should basically be zero tax (with maybe a prompt “please enter some income data”). Ensuring no crashes or nonsense output for edge cases is crucial for reliability.
12.	Stability: The application should run consistently without downtime (aside from server issues beyond app control). The code should not leak memory or resources – given the simple nature, this is not likely an issue. Essentially, any user at any time should be able to trust that the app will load and function as intended.
13.	Security & Privacy: (Some points were touched in functional requirements, but reiterated as non-functional qualities):
14.	Privacy: The design that avoids storing personal data is itself a privacy feature. Additionally, the app should not use third-party trackers that collect data (especially since financial info is sensitive). If analytics are needed, they should be anonymous or opt-in. The site should have a privacy statement aligning with GDPR if it’s public (even if no accounts, IP addresses and such are considered personal data).
15.	Data Security: Inputs are not stored long-term, but while in transit and in memory they should be protected. Use secure connections (HTTPS). On the server side, ensure that the input processing is secure (avoid any possibility that someone could inject code via a field – although fields are numeric, one should still handle them safely).
16.	Deployment environment: If using PHP, keep it updated; similarly for Python environment. The simplicity of tech should mean fewer security issues, but also means we rely on well-tested languages rather than custom implementations.
17.	No Unauthorized Access: Since there’s no user accounts, issues like authentication are minimal. But if future enhancements allowed saving scenarios or user profiles, then authentication and data protection mechanisms would be needed. For now, the stateless design means each session is isolated.
18.	Compatibility: The web app should be compatible with all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and not require any special plugins. The HTML/CSS should be standards-compliant (e.g., HTML5 doctype) so that even older browsers degrade gracefully. Mobile device compatibility is also important – users might want to quickly check their tax on their phone. The design should thus be responsive or at least usable on a small screen (e.g., using CSS media queries to stack fields vertically, etc.). Given the plan for a modern interface eventually, the initial one should not do anything that hampers mobile-friendliness. All text (especially Greek) should render correctly (using UTF-8 encoding).
19.	Scalability: For the expected usage (likely individual taxpayers or small business owners using it occasionally), the app doesn’t need to handle massive load. However, if it became popular, it should scale. Non-functional-wise, this means:
20.	The stateless nature (each calculation is independent) allows easy horizontal scaling (multiple instances behind a load balancer).
21.	The tech choices (PHP/Python) can be deployed on scalable cloud platforms if needed.
22.	Caching is not particularly needed because calculations are user-specific, but if some results were heavy to compute (not likely), caching could be considered for repeated identical inputs. Given the lightweight operations, this is unnecessary at launch.
23.	Simply put, the design should not include any bottlenecks that prevent serving, say, dozens of requests per second. (A single calculation is so fast that even a basic server can handle many per second).
24.	Legal and Ethical Considerations: While not a software performance issue, as a non-functional aspect:
25.	The app must clearly not present itself as an official government tool. All wording and branding should make it clear this is a third-party helper. The disclaimer (functional requirement) is part of this, but also any branding should avoid using official logos or something. Ethically, it should strive to be accurate to not mislead users, and if errors are discovered, update quickly (maintaining trust).
26.	It should also be free to use (since it’s likely a public good type of project). There might be no monetary transactions on the site (no payments), which simplifies compliance (no need for PCI considerations, etc.). If in the future any monetization or premium features are added, that changes the scope (not currently anticipated).
27.	If open-sourced, licensing should be clarified (the presence of a LICENSE file indicates likely an open-source license). This ensures others can contribute or use the code ethically.
28.	Bilingual & Localization: As mentioned, bilingual support is a must. Non-functionally, this means maintaining two sets of text and ensuring the switch is smooth. The text content for Greek and English should be stored in a way that is easy to manage (for instance, a separate language file or resource bundle for each). This design allows adding more languages in the future if desired (e.g., maybe someone wants a German version for fun, or a user-contributed translation). All messages, including errors (“Please enter a valid number” etc.), need translations. Care must be taken that Greek text displays properly (character encoding). The app should also handle different formatting if needed (e.g., in Greek, comma as decimal separator is common in print – but since inputs are fields, probably stick to dot decimal; however, maybe allow either and normalize). Localization also includes potentially different currency formats or punctuation, but since it’s all Euro and mostly numeric, the differences are minor beyond language.
29.	Testing & Quality Assurance: Non-functionally, the project should be developed with testing in mind:
o	Unit tests for the calculation logic (for each module: tax calc, deductions, etc.).
o	Integration tests for the overall flow (simulate a user inputting data and verify the output page).
o	Also, user testing with a few real-world scenarios (maybe compare with an accountant’s calculation or the official TAXISnet calculator if available) to ensure the results match.
o	Given that tax rules can be intricate, a peer review of the tax logic (maybe by someone knowledgeable in Greek taxes) is a good practice to avoid mistakes.
o	All these quality steps ensure that by the time users use it, they get correct results and a smooth experience.
30.     Visual Communication & Accessibility: Present income summaries and interactive charts with accessible colour palettes, clear legends, and a readable hierarchy so users instantly understand how gross income transitions into taxes, contributions, and net take-home pay. Interactive diagrams (such as the Sankey flow) must render high-contrast connectors, hover states, and on-canvas legends that remain legible across light and dark viewing environments while the landing content surfaces concise benefit callouts to orient newcomers.
By adhering to these non-functional requirements, GreekTax will not only function correctly but will also provide a positive user experience, be robust against change, and be trustworthy. The focus on maintainability and accuracy ensures that the tool can be updated every year as needed with minimal hassle, and the focus on usability ensures users can rely on it without confusion. Ultimately, GreekTax aims to be a comprehensive yet simple tax calculator, and these requirements outline how to achieve that in both functionality and quality attributes.
Summary of What the App Will Do
Bringing it all together, GreekTax will serve as a personal tax calculator for Greece, where a user can do the following: select a year, input all their incomes (salary, freelance, rent, etc.), input relevant deductible expenses and other tax-related amounts, and then get a complete breakdown of their tax obligations for that year. Each component of their financial profile is handled: incomes are segregated and taxed with the correct method (progressive rates or flat rates), contributions like EFKA are accounted for (reducing taxable income), and additional taxes like the business fee or ENFIA are included to present a full picture. The output will effectively mimic an unofficial “tax return calculation” showing how the tax is arrived at, but in a user-friendly presentation.
To illustrate a typical use-case: A user in 2025 with a salary and a side gig as a freelancer would open GreekTax, set year to 2025, enter their gross salary (say €30,000) and freelance profit (€10,000), the EFKA they paid for the freelance activity (say €2,500), their rent income (€5,000), and any tax-deductible receipts or donations. Upon calculation, the app would output something like: - Salary €30k -> tax computed on €30k (after automatic salary tax credit) maybe ~€2,500. - Freelance €10k minus €2.5k EFKA = €7.5k taxable -> tax on that (added to salary tax because they combine for progressive) maybe ~€1,000 additional. - Trade fee €650 added (since freelance). - Rent €5k -> taxed at 15% = €750. - Total tax ≈ €2,500+€1,000+€750+€650 = €4,900 (illustrative). - Effective tax rate ~12% on total income. - Net salary after tax&EFKA displayed, net freelance income after tax & EFKA, etc. - Plus any other info if entered (if they put ENFIA €300, it shows separately).
The user sees all this clearly labeled, in Greek or English, and knows what they owe (or what refund to expect if it included withholding etc.). They also see a disclaimer that this is a guide calculation.
Each part of the application – from year selection to final output – has a defined role: - Year selection ensures correctness of rules. - Input fields capture all necessary data (each field representing a specific tax form entry, essentially). - The calculation engine applies the logic for each “thing” (each tax or deduction). - The output part explains what each number means (each “thing” in the output corresponds to an input or a law concept, and we’ve designed it to be comprehensible).
In summary, what each part does is: - Year config: provides the appropriate tax parameters. - Income inputs: let the user specify various income types (salary, freelance, etc.) – each of these feeds into a calculation module for that income type. - Deduction inputs: collect things like contributions and expenses – each of these will adjust the calculation (either subtracting from income or later from tax). - Calculation modules: for each category, compute tax as per rules (progressive or flat); then aggregate. - Output formatter: takes the results and presents them in bilingual, human-readable form, showing each component (each “thing”, like a tax or credit) and the final totals. - Disclaimer & non-official notice: reminds the user that this is a personal tool and not an authoritative assessment.
Through this design, GreekTax will include all major components necessary for a Greek taxpayer’s calculation, using simple and common tools in implementation, and deliver an accessible yet powerful functionality. It will essentially encapsulate the logic of Greek tax forms E1/E2/E3 (income declaration) and associated tax computation rules in a user-friendly web application[25]. By expanding on the initial concept with the above requirements, we have a clear blueprint of features and specifications to proceed with development. The next step would be to implement these in code, guided by this expanded prompt, ensuring each requirement is met and each feature (“each thing”) performs as described to achieve the overall goal of the GreekTax app.
Sources: The requirements and design above were informed by Greek tax law summaries and guidelines, including references on Greek tax forms and rates[25][3], tax treatment of different income types[10][7], additional taxes like the business fee[6], and recent tax policy changes (e.g., abolition of solidarity contribution from 2023)[2]. These sources ensure that the tool’s specifications align with real-world rules and terminology.
