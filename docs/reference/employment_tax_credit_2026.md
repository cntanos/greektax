# 2026 employment tax credit reference (Taxheaven)

*Source: Taxheaven analysis of the 2026 wage tax scales, published 9 September 2025 — https://www.taxheaven.gr/news/71602/oi-nees-analytikes-klimakes-forologias-2026-sygkrish-2025-2026*

Taxheaven’s article provides the 2026 tax-free income thresholds (“αφορολόγητα ποσά”) for employees and pensioners, broken down by dependant count. For taxpayers over 30 — the population covered by the general employment tables in our calculator — the ladder reads:

| Dependants | Tax-free income (€) |
|-----------:|--------------------:|
| 0 | 8 633 |
| 1 | 10 000 |
| 2 | 11 375 |
| 3 | 14 364 |
| 4 | 27 100 |
| 5 | 30 529 |

We convert these thresholds into tax credit amounts by applying the statutory 2026 employment rates from our configuration:

- Dependants 0–2 retain the familiar 777 €, 900 €, and 1 120 € credits. The new thresholds back-solve to these figures when you apply the 9 %/18 %/20 % bands shown in the article’s tables.
- Three dependants now correspond to a credit of **1 292.76 €**, equal to the tax owed on 14 364 € with the 9 %/9 %/20 % band mix.
- Four dependants map to **1 278 €**, the tax generated by the 20 000–27 100 € slice taxed at 18 % while the first 20 000 € remains untaxed.
- Five dependants equate to **1 779.86 €**, blending 16 % tax on the 20 000–30 000 € segment and 34 % on the next 529 €.
- The Taxheaven piece does not publish amounts beyond five dependants; we continue to carry forward the ministry’s +220 €/child ladder for 6+ children until the government releases updated guidance.

The employment credit continues to phase out at **20 € per 1 000 €** of declared wage income above 12 000 € for households with up to four dependants. Families with five or more dependants remain exempt from the reduction. These assumptions are unchanged from previous years while we await official clarification accompanying the new thresholds.

## 2026 progressive brackets published by Taxheaven

The same Taxheaven article provides the progressive bracket matrix for wage and pension income. Our 2026 configuration mirrors those tables band for band:

- **0–10 000 €:** 9 % for households with up to three dependants, 0 % for four or more; the youth scales reduce this band to 0 % for taxpayers under 25 and keep the 9 %/0 % split for ages 26–30.
- **10 000,01–20 000 €:** 20 %, 18 %, 16 %, 9 % for households with zero to three dependants and 0 % thereafter; youth under 25 remain at 0 % and ages 26–30 stay at 9 % for up to three dependants.
- **20 000,01–30 000 €:** 26 %, 24 %, 22 %, 20 %, 18 %, 16 %, 14 % across the dependant ladder, shared by all age tables.
- **30 000,01–40 000 €:** flat 34 % across all dependant counts and age categories.
- **40 000,01–60 000 €:** flat 39 % across all dependant counts and age categories.
- **>60 000 €:** flat 44 % across all dependant counts and age categories.

The new unit test `test_2026_employment_brackets_match_taxheaven_tables` locks these rates so any future adjustments to the configuration must stay aligned with the Taxheaven source.

Updated regression anchors (employment only, 2026 tables, no contributions) derived from the Taxheaven thresholds and the statutory rates:

| Dependants | 12 000 € | 20 000 € | 30 000 € | 50 000 € | 70 000 € |

These figures anchor the automated regression tests until the Ministry publishes its official circular with full dependant coverage.

## Reconciling the published “tax-free” incomes with the reduction rule

Taxheaven’s headline allowances assume the full dependant credit is available at the stated income, but the payroll credit still diminishes by 20 € per additional 1 000 € of declared wages for households with fewer than five dependants. As a result, taxpayers with three or four children face a residual charge at the published thresholds and only reach zero tax once their income drops to the point where the reduced credit fully offsets the computed liability.

| Dependants | Published threshold (€) | Tax before credit (€) | Credit applied (€) | Residual tax (€) | Income with zero tax after reduction (€) |
|-----------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|-------------------:|-----------------:|----------------------------------------:|
| 0 | 8 633 | 776.97 | 776.97 | 0.00 | 8 633.00 |
| 1 | 10 000 | 900.00 | 900.00 | 0.00 | 10 000.00 |
| 2 | 11 375 | 1 120.00 | 1 120.00 | 0.00 | 11 375.00 |
| 3 | 14 364 | 1 292.76 | 1 245.48 | 47.28 | 13 934.18 |
| 4 | 27 100 | 1 278.00 | 976.00 | 302.00 | 25 590.00 |
| 5 | 30 529 | 1 779.86 | 1 779.86 | 0.00 | 30 529.00 |

The unit tests cover both the Taxheaven anchors and these residual differences so future calculator changes cannot inadvertently relax the reduction rule for medium-sized households.
