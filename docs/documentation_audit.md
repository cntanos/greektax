# Documentation Audit – 2024-05-19

## Scope
Inventory of README.md, Requirements.md, and documentation under docs/ to flag overlapping or outdated sections that need consolidation or revision.

## Findings
| Document | Section | Status | Notes | Suggested action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| README.md | Architecture Overview | Overlapping | Restates module boundary details already captured in docs/architecture.md without referencing that source. | Trim README summary to a high-level blurb and link directly to docs/architecture.md for deep dives. |
| README.md | Refreshing front-end translations | Overlapping | Repeats the end-to-end workflow maintained in docs/i18n.md. Minor divergences (e.g., phrasing) create drift risk. | Replace with a short pointer to docs/i18n.md so the workflow lives in a single location. |
| README.md | Performance Snapshot | Overlapping | Mirrors guidance from docs/performance_baseline.md. Divergent command formatting (“python …” vs executable script) could confuse contributors. | Consolidate instructions under docs/performance_baseline.md and keep README to a brief teaser + link. |
| docs/architecture.md | Deployment Interaction | Overlapping | Duplicates API base-switch guidance later repeated in README.md (“Configuring the API endpoint”). | Decide which doc owns deployment toggle instructions; cross-link the other to avoid drift. |
| docs/project_plan.md | Documentation references | Outdated | Plan does not yet reference the new documentation audit/style baseline maintainers should follow. | Add links to docs/documentation_audit.md and docs/documentation_style.md in the planning overview so future updates use the shared baseline. |

## Next Review
Re-evaluate after consolidating the duplicated sections or when major architectural shifts land to ensure the canonical sources stay aligned.
